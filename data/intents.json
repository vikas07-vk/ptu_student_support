Some specialized courses like MBA and MCA also have placement rates, but these figures are generally lower than those of B.Tech students.

This was for a B.Tech student who likely had specialized skills that matched the needs of top-tier companies. However, it's important to remember that this is an outlier, and the typical salaries offered at PTU's placements range from \u20b93 LPA to \u20b95 LPA on average, especially for B.Tech students.

This number can vary annually, and it depends on the number of students, industries hiring, and the available opportunities in each academic year. Other courses like MBA and MCA usually have slightly lower placement percentages compared to B.Tech, especially since placements are industry-specific.",

However, it is a fair placement rate for a university with a wide variety of engineering, management, and other courses.
